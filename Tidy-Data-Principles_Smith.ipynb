For example, the season column should have the year written out in full as some entrys have \"17\" and some have \"2017\". Another example is the affiliate column which some entrys have the teams abreviation like \"DET\" while others have the team name like \"Detriot Tigers\" so each column having the abreviation and another table explaining those abreviations would be best practice. Finally, in the classification column some entrys had \"Double A\" and other have \"AA\" which should just be streamlined to the \"AA\" abreviation with a separate table explaining what that means. </Blockquote>"

When looking at the data set, one thing i noticed was that the data wasnt inharently wrong its just that it didnt match up. this could have been done if two people were working on the data set at once as one would lik to add written out versions of information while the other abreviates. This can be addressed however by having a strong set of rules while entering data similar to the normalization rules. So, if all data in in third normal form, there is no disconnect. </Blockquote>"
